      The official colour of the millennium and Pantone's inaugural colour of
      the year is Cerulean Blue PANTONE 15-4020. Cerulean reflects the colour of
      the sky on a serene, crystal clear day. Lifestyle movements suggest that
      consumers will be seeking inner peace and spiritual fulfilment in 2000.
      The new millennium is a paradoxical time in which we are heading toward an
      uncertain, yet exciting, future, and also looking back, trying to hold
      onto the security of the past. In this stressful, high-tech era, people
      will be searching for solace and Cerulean Blue produces the perfect
      calming effect.


      Pantone Institute studies show that blue is the leading favourite colour for designers and consumers around the world, transcending culture or gender. The viewing of blue creates a calming effect and could help to reduce blood pressure, heartbeat and respiration rates. Psychologically, gazing at a clear blue sky brings a sense of peace and tranquillity to the human spirit. Surrounding yourself with Cerulean blue could bring on a certain peace because it reminds us of time spent outdoors, on the beach, near water and sparks associations with restful, peaceful, relaxing times, making the unknown a little less frightening.

      Pantone is pleased to announce PANTONE 15-5519 Turquoise, an inviting,
      luminous hue, as the Color of the Year for 2010. Combining the serene
      qualities of blue and the invigorating aspects of green, Turquoise

      In many cultures, Turquoise is believed to be a protective talisman, a color of deep compassion and healing, and a color of faith and truth, inspired by water and sky. Through years of color word-association studies, we also find that to many people, Turquoise represents an escape, taking them to a tropical paradise that is pleasant and inviting – even if it is only a fantasy.


      Whether envisioned as a tranquil ocean surrounding a tropical island or a protective stone warding off evil spirits, Turquoise is a color that most people respond to positively. It is universally flattering, has appeal for men and women, and translates easily to fashion and interiors. With both warm and cool undertones, Turquoise pairs nicely with any other color in the spectrum. Turquoise adds a splash of excitement to neutrals and browns, complements reds and pinks, creates a classic maritime look with deep blues, livens up all other greens, and is especially trend-setting with yellow-greens.

      uplifting. It elevates our psyche beyond escape, instilling the
      confidence, courage and spirit to meet the exhaustive challenges that have
      become part of everyday life.


      “In times of stress, we need something to lift our spirits. Honeysuckle is a captivating, stimulating color that gets the adrenaline going – perfect to ward off the blues,” explains Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute®. “Honeysuckle derives its positive qualities from a powerful bond to its mother color red, the most physical, viscerally alive hue in the spectrum.”


      Eiseman continues, “The intensity of this festive reddish pink allures and engages. In fact, this color, not the sweet fragrance of the flower blossoms for which it was named, is what attracts hummingbirds to nectar. Honeysuckle may also bring a wave of nostalgia for its associated delicious scent reminiscent of the carefree days of spring and summer.”


      Honeysuckle is guaranteed to produce a healthy glow when worn by both men and women. It’s a striking, eye-catching hue that works well for day and night in women’s apparel, accessories and cosmetics, and in men’s ties, shirts and sportswear.

      As consumers seek mindfulness and well-being as an antidote to modern day
      stresses, welcoming colors that psychologically fulfill our yearning for
      reassurance and security are becoming more prominent. Joined together,
      Rose Quartz and Serenity demonstrate an inherent balance between a warmer
      embracing rose tone and the cooler tranquil blue, reflecting connection
      and wellness as well as a soothing sense of order and peace.


      The prevalent combination of Rose Quartz and Serenity also challenges traditional perceptions of color association.


      In many parts of the world we are experiencing a gender blur as it relates to fashion, which has in turn impacted color trends throughout all other areas of design. This more unilateral approach to color is coinciding with societal movements toward gender equality and fluidity, the consumer's increased comfort with using color as a form of expression, a generation that has less concern about being typecast or judged and an open exchange of digital information that has opened our eyes to different approaches to color usage.
