This hearty, yet stylish tone is universally appealing and translates easily to fashion, beauty, industrial design, home furnishings and interiors.

The Versatility of Marsala

* Equally appealing to men and women, Marsala is a stirring and flavorful shade for apparel and accessories, one that encourages color creativity and experimentation
* Flattering against many skin tones, sultry and subtle Marsala is a great go-to color for beauty, providing enormous highlight for the cheek, and a captivating pop of color for nails, shadows lips and hair.
* Dramatic and at the same time grounding, the rich and full-bodied red-brown Marsala brings color warmth into home interiors
* An earthy shade with a bit of sophistication, texture is the story in print and packaging. A matte finish highlights Marsalaâ€™s organic nature while adding a sheen conveys a completely different message of glamour and luxury.
