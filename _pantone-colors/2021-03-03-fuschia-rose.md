Drastically different from the pervious years colourÂ [Cerulean Blue](https://www.nationalcoloursupplies.com/index.php?route=blog/blog/view&blog_id=34), Fuchsia Rose PANTONE 17-2031 is much more exciting, and will appeal to everyones feminine side. Brighter, stronger, sexier, that's Pantone's colour message for 2001.
