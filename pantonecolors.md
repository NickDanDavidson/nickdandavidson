title: Pantone Colors of the Year
subtitle: 2000 - present
copy: >-
  I both love and hate the Pantone system of colors. On the one hand, they
  literally trademarked nature. They took color combinations that are available
  to anyone and gave them names. On the other hand, they gave them names! It's
  annoyingly useful. Even more fun, they started a tradition at the turn of the
  millennium of naming a Color of the Year for the upcoming year â€” colors that,
  in their minds, set the mood for the year ahead. They take into account the
  zeitgeist as well as their hopes for what is to come.


  I noticed there was no real space to see or interact with these Colors of the Year, so I thought it would be a great project for me. I hope you enjoy!
